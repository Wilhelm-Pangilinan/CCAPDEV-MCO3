# Lab Reservation System

The Lab Reservation System is a web-based application designed to facilitate the reservation and management of laboratory resources. It provides a convenient and efficient way for users to reserve specific lab equipment, rooms, or time slots for their academic, research, or professional needs.

## Getting Started

You may view this web application via https://lab-reservation-system-for-ccapdev.onrender.com or you may clone this repository and host the application locally.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your computer:

Node.js: You can download and install Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/
MongoDB: Install MongoDB and make sure it's running on your local machine. You can download MongoDB from the official website: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community

### Setting up Locally
1. Clone or download the repository: First, you need to obtain the Lab Reservation System codebase. You can either clone the repository from the project's GitHub page or download the zip file and extract it.

2. Install npm modules: Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory and run the following command to install the required npm modules: 
"npm install"
This will fetch and install all the necessary dependencies for the project.
"npm install dotenv"

3. Configure MongoDB: Make sure MongoDB is running on your local machine or change the MongoDB connection string in the application to connect to your MongoDB database. 

4. Start the Node.js server: Once all the dependencies are installed and MongoDB is running, start the Node.js server by running one of the following commands:
"node app.js" or "npm start"

5. Access the application: The server should now be running, and you can access the Lab Reservation System through your web browser by navigating to: 
"http://localhost:3000"
